# RPS Game Frontend
Frontend for two-player rock-paper-scissors game.
this is a really bad game as its really easy to cheat
also i am shit at css
# How to Use
1. Download the repo from github
2. (OPTIONAL) Download the back end of this project from [here.](https://github.com/SkaLiXuR/rps-game-server)
3. If you're hosting the server, the console output will give you the address,
4. Otherwise, if you're not hosting the server, ask whoever is to give you the address
5. Open `index.html` and paste the address of the server. This will redirect you to a different page (player one or two)
6. aand you're done. really wasnt that hard

## TODO
- Add support for custom names
- Add score system
- Add easier to customize background color and images
- fix the css (this is never happening)
